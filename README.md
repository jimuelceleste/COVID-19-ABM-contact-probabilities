# COVID-19 ABM with contact-probabilities

A generic COVID-19 agent-based model (age-stratified, quarantine modified, with non-linear incidence) coupled with the social contact matrices of Prem et al. [1] as interaction probabilities. 

This model was used for the simulation of school reopening scenarios in Quezon City [2] and all the Philippine regions [3]. 

The model is a modification of the COVID-19 ABM for Quezon City, Philippines [4].
