# COVID-19 ABM with contact probabilities

A generic COVID-19 agent-based model (age-stratified, quarantine modified, with non-linear incidence) coupled with the social contact matrices of Prem et al. [1] as interaction probabilities. This model was used for the simulation of school reopening scenarios in Quezon City [2], Pasig City [3], and all the Philippine regions [4]. The model is a modification of the COVID-19 ABM for Quezon City, Philippines [5].
